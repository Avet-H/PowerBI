These are some example projects developed by Power BI Desctop 


1. -Project_
Billionaire- Ive always been curious about the wealth distribution across countries, industries, companies and even individuals. Here is some descriptive graphs and indicators that I developed by using data published by Forbes about Billionaires at the end of 2022. In the same file you can find a page report presenting GDP data from 2021 according to WorldBank data and compare those numbers to get an interesting insight. Appearantly, if we sort countries by theiir GDP in ascending order and combine GDPs of first 165 countries we will get about $11.5 trillion which is approximately the same amount as 2490 billionaires' net wort together!
